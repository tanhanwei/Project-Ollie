I have generated a powerful web scrapper agent named `web_scrapper_agent.py` that can extract article content from given URLs using the newspaper library.
This code defines a class called `WebScrapperAgent` that inherits from the `AgentBase` class.
The `__init__` method initializes the agent with a `data_store` to store data, a list of `functions` that the agent can execute, and a `model` that is used to generate responses.
The `get_functions` method returns a dictionary of functions that the agent can execute.
The `extract_article_content` function extracts the content of an article from a given URL using the `newspaper` library.
The `generate_response` method generates a response based on the user's prompt by executing a sequence of functions.
The response is then saved to a file and returned.
To use this agent, you can create an instance of the `WebScrapperAgent` class and call the `generate_response` method with a prompt.
The prompt should include the URL of the article that you want to extract the content from.
The agent will then extract the content of the article and save it to a file.
