A report on sustainability and change in the South East Asia region produced by Fashion Revolution Singapore and Oxford Development Consultancy (ODC). The ends of opaque and multilayered supply chains – particularly in Southeast Asia (SEA) – often have catastrophic results to the workers’ safety and wellbeing due to lack of accountability, transparency and measures designed for their protection. These issues have yet again re-emerged following the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the lack of permanent contracts, safety nets and sick leave, millions have been casted into economic precarity following the temporary collapse of the fashion industry. Southeast Asia has high potential to lead change towards a greener, socially just future of fashion. By looking into the efforts of governments, NGOs, designers, brands and customers themselves, the report seeks to grasp the ongoing global sustainability momentum, relating to the environmental and ethical impact of fashion in SEA.
