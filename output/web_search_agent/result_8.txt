Strong Consumer Demand in Southeast Asia Drives the Development of Fashion E-commerce Fashion Categories Steadily Dominate E-commerce Bestseller Lists, Highlighting Five Key Consumer Trends Content-driven Fashion E-commerce Flourishes: "Her Economy" and Low-Cost Consumption Take the Lead





According to data from Statista, the projected revenue of the Southeast Asian fashion industry will reach 23.79 billion USD in 2023, with the market size expected to reach 310 billion USD. By 2027, the user penetration rate in the Southeast Asian fashion industry is also projected to increase from 31.6% in 2023 to 41.3%.





As the penetration rate of e-commerce continues to rise in Southeast Asia, the fashion industry is also increasingly digitalized. With the continuous exploration of consumer potential in Southeast Asia, fashion e-commerce is expected to continue to benefit from favorable opportunities. Specifically, fashion e-commerce covers various categories such as clothing (men's, women's, and children's apparel), footwear (sandals, leather shoes, sports shoes, etc.), luggage and bags (suitcases, wallets, briefcases, etc.), and accessories (hats, watches, and jewelry).





Among them, the fashion apparel category has shown outstanding sales performance in the Southeast Asian e-commerce field, and this article primarily focuses on fashion apparel. Moreover, the future potential of the fashion apparel category is also considerable. According to the Regional Digital Economy Insights report published by Lazada, the number of users in the Southeast Asian e-commerce fashion apparel industry is expected to increase from 196 million in 2022 to 255 million in 2025.





In addition, this article will also emphasize the overall market performance of Southeast Asian platform e-commerce, content-driven e-commerce, and fashion DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) players in the fashion category. Furthermore, the article will explore the new fashion consumption demands of local consumers and the challenges and opportunities that Southeast Asian fashion e-commerce may face in the future.





Strong Consumer Demand in Southeast Asia Drives the Development of Fashion E-commerce





With the continuous increase in internet penetration and the development of the e-commerce industry in Southeast Asia, people's shopping habits have undergone significant changes, with online shopping becoming a habit. Additionally, Southeast Asia, with its population of over 600 million, has a relatively young population structure, with 70% of the total population being 44 years old or younger, and the median age of the population is generally below 30 years old. This young demographic is highly influenced by local fashion trends, leading to a gradual increase in online shopping demand for fashion products.





The Booming Southeast Asian E-commerce Market with Fashion as the Preferred Category





According to the joint 2022 Southeast Asia Internet Report by Temasek, Bain, and Google, it is estimated that the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of Southeast Asian e-commerce will reach 211 billion USD by 2025. The report also points out that the e-commerce industry in Southeast Asia is exhibiting an S-shaped growth curve, and after experiencing a turning point from 2020 to 2022, it is expected to continue growing due to strong demand for online shopping in Southeast Asia. Among the various categories, fashion is one of the main focuses of Southeast Asian consumers.





The Southeast Asian region has diverse cultures and fashion trends, and the market demand for products such as clothing and footwear continues to be driven by fashion trends. The fashion industry offers a wide range of product types and style choices, catering to consumers' diverse and personalized shopping needs. Therefore, in this vast market, the fashion category has become the preferred choice for major e-commerce platforms.





Overall, women's apparel and accessories are the most popular categories among consumers. Additionally, there is an increasing demand and purchasing power for fashion categories among men, including men's clothing and bags. As for the children's apparel market, future growth is also foreseeable due to the large overall child population in Southeast Asia and the higher birth rates in countries like the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand, which are leading to faster growth in the children's fashion category.





A Vast Young Internet Population with Fashion Demands Influenced by the Internet





Facebook IQ's research data estimated that by 2022, the middle-class population in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore is expected to reach 350 million people, with a total disposable income of 300 billion USD. The immense population advantage and the increase in the middle-income group will strongly drive the region's consumer market.





Moreover, the region's internet development exhibits two significant characteristics. Firstly, the number of internet users continues to increase. According to the 2022 Southeast Asia Internet Economy report jointly published by Temasek, Bain, and Google, the number of internet users in Southeast Asia increased by 100 million during the three-year period from 2019 to 2022, surpassing a total of 460 million.





Secondly, Southeast Asian users are heavy internet users. According to the latest data from We Are Social, the average time spent by mobile internet users in Southeast Asian countries is much higher than that in Europe, the US, and East Asian countries. For example, in 2021, the average time spent by internet users in the Philippines exceeded 10 hours, while in the same year, Chinese internet users spent an average of 5 hours and 15 minutes, and Japanese users spent less than 4.5 hours. By 2022, the average time spent by internet users in the Philippines slightly decreased but remained over 9 hours.





Southeast Asian youth already have different pursuits in fashion, and prolonged internet browsing further stimulates their purchasing demands. Many fashion brands and e-commerce platforms actively use social media for promotion and marketing. Additionally, self-media users, fashion bloggers, etc., showcase their fashion styles and shopping experiences on social media platforms, attracting a large number of consumers' attention and "imitation." It is said that Southeast Asian locals' dressing styles are highly influenced by the internet, and the influence of social media prompts them to purchase similar fashion products on e-commerce platforms to follow the latest trends.





Shifting Consumer Behavior in Pandemic: Embracing Online Fashion Shopping





Due to the impact of the pandemic, the Southeast Asian fashion market has undergone significant changes. On one hand, the demand for fashion products such as clothing has increased among Southeast Asian consumers, with more people turning to online shopping. On the other hand, during the pandemic, consumers' preference for casual and sporty clothing, like outfits suitable for online video conferences, has increased compared to workwear. According to data from Zalora Indonesia, sales of shirts and waist-cinching outerwear increased by 2%, while the popularity of dresses decreased by 7%.





Additionally, due to the widespread use of remote online education and the faster renewal cycle of children's clothing compared to adult clothing, online consumption of children's apparel in households has significantly increased. During the pandemic lockdown period, there was a significant growth in the sales of children's apparel in Indonesia. In 2020, sales of children's T-shirts increased by 16%, and dresses increased by 6%.





Post-pandemic, Southeast Asian fashion e-commerce will also witness a new wave of favorable opportunities. With the increasing demand for fashion brands and diverse consumer needs, segment-specific fashion categories can address specific pain points and capture the minds of Southeast Asian consumers.





Fashion Categories Steadily Dominate E-commerce Bestseller Lists, Revealing Five Key Consumer Trends





Shopee, Lazada, Tokopedia (now Goto), Bukalapak, Sendo, and Tiki are all local e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, and these comprehensive platforms often cover popular product categories such as electronics, fashion apparel, beauty and skincare, baby products, and home goods. Among them, fashion categories such as clothing, shoes, bags, and accessories are best-selling on these e-commerce platforms.





For example, during last year's Lazada's birthday promotion, cross-border merchants' sales revenue for women's swimwear quadrupled compared to the same period last year, while the hair accessory category reached nearly three times the sales volume. In the Vietnamese market, women's tops and dresses reached 200% of the sales volume on the 12.12 shopping festival last year. Among them, the stylized fashion brand VERO MODA achieved a 580%+ increase in sales on the first day of the promotion, with over 1200 dresses sold within 10 minutes. In this year's Lazada birthday promotion, Chinese brands 361 Degrees and ZOJIRUSHI achieved good results in Southeast Asia. ZOJIRUSHI's sales on Lazada Thailand ranked among the top five in all stores and countries.





Similarly, fashion categories have performed well on the Shopee e-commerce platform, with fashion being a year-round focus of Shopee's cross-border sales. According to the Q1 2023 bestsellers on Shopee, women's apparel ranked third in the cross-border category, covering a wide range of types and styles, and fashion accessories ranked fourth. Women's apparel and fashion accessories were peak sellers in the markets of Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. In the cross-border bestsellers, yoga pants, casual men's wear, and color-changing eyewear performed exceptionally well.





Taking Shopee and Lazada as examples, these two e-commerce platforms regularly summarize the sales trends of Southeast Asian fashion categories, with slight differences in popular fashion categories during different periods. Based on the bestseller lists of these two platforms in the first half of this year, we can observe some key characteristics of Southeast Asian fashion e-commerce.





Shopee:

Women's Apparel: Dresses, modern Malay outfits, and blouses are popular items. Summer apparel such as short-sleeve blouses and skirts are in demand, and different styles of women's clothing, such as Y2K, sweet and spicy, and cool and spicy, also have potential.

Men's Apparel: Korean casual style and solid-color or black-and-white simple styles are popular sellers.

Children's Apparel: New clothes for children, children's backpacks, tops, shorts, dresses, and children's shoes are strong categories.

Shoes: Women's shoes mainly include high heels, sandals, flip-flops, and canvas shoes; men's shoes mainly include sports shoes and stylish sandals, with strong demand for men's flip-flops and sandals.

Bags: Various styles of shoulder bags, makeup bags, and backpacks are regular bestsellers.





Lazada:

Women's Apparel: Resort-style, casual Korean style, and lightweight dresses are popular, as well as basic/sporty midriff tops, oversize T-shirts, long pants, and hoodie jackets.

Men's Apparel: Simple T-shirts, polo shirts, and solid-color shirts are popular, as well as streetwear and workwear styles targeting young people.

Children's Apparel: Tops, shorts, dresses, and children's shoes are strong categories.

Shoes: Women's shoes focus on high heels, sandals, flip-flops, and canvas shoes, while men's shoes focus on sports shoes and stylish sandals.

Men's bags mainly consist of hot-selling business and casual styles with high cost performance.

Accessories: Women like accessories such as watches and necklaces.





From the summaries of the two major platforms, we can see the following characteristics of Southeast Asian fashion categories:





Southeast Asian fashion products have a primary demand in the summer season. The region has a hot climate throughout the year, making short-sleeve blouses, skirts, and shorts consistently popular. Due to the year-round high temperatures and frequent rainfall in Southeast Asia, demand for flip-flops and sandals remains strong. Additionally, due to long hours spent in air-conditioned rooms, long pants and hoodie jackets are favored by local consumers. Southeast Asian fashion consumption is influenced by festival shopping trends. For example, the sales of high heels have always surged during Ramadan in Malaysia, and Thailand sees increased purchases of floral shirts, dresses, and comfortable tank tops for the Songkran Festival. Furthermore, back-to-school season brings a surge in sales for children's backpacks, watches, and apparel. Preferences for fashion products vary by region in Southeast Asia. For instance, the Thai and Filipino markets are more interested in European and American style women's bags, while the Malaysian market prefers local bag brands, and the Vietnamese market favors Japanese and Korean fresh style bags. Additionally, in the Malaysian fashion apparel category, traditional clothing, wide-leg pants, and anti-sun shirts are popular. These differences may be influenced by regional culture and consumer aesthetic preferences. Southeast Asian Fashion Categories Exhibit Stylistic Trends. For example, Y2K, Sweet and Spicy, and Cool and Spicy women's fashion styles show potential for high sales. Additionally, the 25-35-year-old white-collar mature group has a higher demand for fitted dresses, sets, and simple commuter fashion. Southeast Asian Fashion Trends Influenced by Korean and Japanese Styles. Casual Korean fashion has been repeatedly mentioned, and Korean and Japanese style bags are widely popular. In Thailand, where the Korean wave is prevalent, female fans love buying celebrity-endorsed bags. Additionally, the influence of Korean girl group styles has led to a local trend of pairing short tops and oversized blazers with high-waisted pants.





In conclusion, sales data and consumer trends on Southeast Asian e-commerce platforms show a continuous increase in demand for fashion products in the region. Seasonal, festival, and regional factors influence consumer buying behavior, and different styles and product categories are favored by specific consumer groups. Understanding these characteristics can help businesses better seize market opportunities and meet consumer needs.





Content E-commerce Filled with Fashion Sense; 'She Economy' and Low-Cost Consumption Dominate





Apart from platform e-commerce, the fashion category also performs well in live streaming/content e-commerce, with a particular focus on the popular TikTok platform. According to the "2023 First Half of the Year TikTok Industry White Paper" published by Fast Data, Muslim fashion, women's clothing & lingerie, men's clothing & lingerie, and footwear are among the top-ranking fashion categories in terms of leading live streaming sales, product sales, and small store revenue in various Southeast Asian countries, such as:





Indonesia

In the first half of 2023, the top 20 product sales in Indonesia came from four categories: beauty & personal care, food & beverages, Muslim fashion, and health. Among Muslim fashion brands in Indonesia, KENAN HIJAB INDONESIA, which mainly focuses on Muslim women's headscarves, ranks as the top store in its category.

Apart from the data characteristics, Southeast Asian TikTok small stores in the fashion category also have the following features:





Southeast Asian Muslim fashion plays a significant role, combining fashion trends with religious and cultural aspects. In the Indonesian, Malaysian, and Thai markets, Muslim fashion is an essential part of fashion consumption, with Muslim clothing often being one of the best-selling clothing categories. Meanwhile, Indonesian and Malaysian Muslim women, unlike their Middle Eastern counterparts, typically do not wear full veils. Even with headscarves (hijab), they still emphasize wearing trendy clothing. Additionally, Malaysian Muslim women's clothing also focuses on patterns and styles, and some simple and loose-fitting shirt dress suits are popular on Malaysian TikTok small stores. Southeast Asian women's clothing and lingerie are major sales categories. Female consumers in Southeast Asia have a strong demand and purchasing power for fashion, and most of them prefer buying multiple items at once, reflecting diverse aesthetics. Simple loose tops and solid-color t-shirts are popular, and various styles of dresses also have a market. However, it is worth noting that the "He Economy," represented by men's clothing and men's lingerie, is also on the rise in Southeast Asia, as evident in the top-ranking live streaming room in Vietnam in the first half of 2023. Apart from clothing categories, other fashion categories also have unique features. For instance, in Thailand, fashionable accessories such as multi-colored, face-shaping, and 3D dust-proof masks can also become hot-selling items. In the Philippines, the luggage and bag category's total revenue for the small store HOLO can reach millions of US dollars. Fashion products on Southeast Asian TikTok are primarily low-cost. According to the "2023 First Half of the Year TikTok Industry White Paper," the average unit price of women's clothing & lingerie category products in the UK is around 41.61 US dollars, far exceeding that of the five Southeast Asian countries. The average unit prices for women's clothing & lingerie category products in the five Southeast Asian countries are as follows: Malaysia 8.53 US dollars, Vietnam 7.71 US dollars, Thailand 6.61 US dollars, Indonesia 5.57 US dollars, and the Philippines 3.40 US dollars. Besides the women's clothing & lingerie category, the average unit prices for other popular fashion categories are also not high.





Overall, from the perspective of TikTok e-commerce markets in different Southeast Asian countries, the fashion category remains one of the hottest-selling categories. Due to cultural differences in different countries, local people also have different preferences and choices in fashion consumption. However, some commonalities are apparent, such as the dominance of the female consumer market and the prevalence of low-cost products. In-depth understanding of the Southeast Asian TikTok e-commerce market can also unearth more sales potential related to fashion categories.
