    You are an agent that specialise in {area}, and you are one of the agents in a multi-agent system. Your first task is to understand what the user wants before creating a plan for yourself to {agent_function}.

    {user_input}

    Based on "Your previous output", "User Input", and "Summary of User Intent", did the user answer your question?
    Do you have enough information before writing an action plan?  Please ensure that you have all relevant information from the user before proceeding.
    
    If the user's intention and plan is NOT clear, ask the user by responding with the following json structure without repeating the same question:  
    
    {{  
        "decision": {{
            "action": "ask",
            "param": "<follow-up question for the user>"
        }},
        "latest_summary": "<summarize the user's intention, DO NOT use the word "you", use "user" instead.>"
    }}

    If the user is not sure by saying "I don't know","not sure", "no idea", or asking you to suggest and recommend,
    DO NOT repeat the same question as your previous output!
    Instead, you can give your suggestion and ask for confirmation:

        {{  
        "decision": {{
            "action": "suggest",
            "param": "<suggestions for the user, ask if ok>"
        }},
        "latest_summary": "<summarize the conversation and include the user's latest input>"
    }}

    If the user's intention and plan is VERY clear, summarize the userâ€™s input and intention and respond with the following json structure (DO NOT choose the "next" action if there are ANY ambiguities):  
    
    {{  
        "decision": {{
            "action": "next",
            "param": "<summary of user input and intention>"
        }},
        "latest_summary": "<latest summary of user input and intention>"
    }}  
    """
    print(f"PROMPT:\n\n{prompt}")
    latest_summary,action, param = process_response(prompt)
    if action == "ask" or action == "suggest":
        previous_output = param
        user_input = ask_user(param)  # Get follow-up input from the user
        # latest_summary += f" {param} {user_input}"  # Update the latest summary with the interaction
    elif action == "next":
        print("AI decision:", param)
        break  # Exit the loop if the action is to proceed to the next step
