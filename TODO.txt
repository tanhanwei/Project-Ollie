All agent prompts are loaded inside main.py, I think they should be loaded individually inside their respective agent class.
Likewise for master agent's prompt, it shouldn't be loaded in main.

Last thing added:
- manager agent class
- master agent class
Haven't modified main.py to use the manager agent class.
