As a Senior Game Designer at Tencent, I'm always challenged to know the latest trend in the gaming industry. Sometimes, due to time constraints, I just don't have the time to have a first hand experience for most games that are under my radar. In addition, not only I need to know what makes a game special, I also need to know how well it did in the gaming industry. It is also essential for me to understand how players feel about certain game features. Therefore, I do a lot of research at work to ensure that I'm equipped with the latest and most relevant knowledge daily. Here's what I'll normally do:

1. Trend Research. What is the latest, up and coming game?
2. Game genre research. This is useful is the company is explring some new game genres.
3. Reception. How did the players respond to the game? What did they love and hate about the game? This is usually what I did for new games that has been announced, yet to release.
4. Competitive Analysis. What makes our competitive game so good (or bad), and what can I learn from them?
5. Player behaviour analysis. This helps me to understand how player actually spend time in the game and what they like and dislike about the game.
Technologicla advancements. This is to see how I can further refine player experience in the future, especially in the area of AR, VR, and AI.
6. Cross-industry learning. Sometimes, I also need to learn something that can be adapted for gaming, such as movies and novels. There were times I had to watch movies and read novels, and write a report as well.

For 1 - 5, I mainly use reddit, youtube comments, steam reviews, and simple web search. Am I missing anything?
