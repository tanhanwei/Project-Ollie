# arxiv_agent.py
# Gemini: I have generated the code for an agent that can interact with the arXiv API. I named it `arxiv_agent.py`. The code is saved in the `output/arxiv_agent` directory.

# Here's a brief explanation of the code:

# - The `arxiv_agent.py` file defines a class called `ArxivAgent` that inherits from the `AgentBase` class.
# - The `ArxivAgent` class has two main methods:
#   - `search_papers`: This method takes a search query, start index, and maximum number of results as input, and returns the raw API response containing matching papers in Atom format.
#   - `get_paper_details`: This method takes an arXiv ID as input, and returns the raw API response containing paper details in Atom format.
# - The `generate_response` method is the entry point for the agent. It takes the user's prompt as input, and generates a response based on the prompt, interacting with the arXiv API as needed.
# - The `save_response` method can be used to save the API response or other data to a file.

# To use the agent, you can create an instance of the `ArxivAgent` class, and then call the `generate_response` method with the user's prompt as input. The agent will then interact with the arXiv API as needed, and generate a response based on the prompt.
